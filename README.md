# WebAuthn Demo

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed and ready to go, as well as
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Also, please use `pnpm` as your package manager. If you do not have `pnpm` yet, you can it install it with

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

In your terminal, execute the following command to set the correct node version

```shell
nvm use
```

Start the project with

```shell
pnpm dev
```
